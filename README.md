# Space Invaders in PYGAME
## The goal of this project
My goal was to learn pygame and enhance my python developing skills while developing a classical game and to create a different interpretation on the Space Invaders game. In my interpretation, you control a spaceship that is trying to evade obstacles(in this case it's asteroids). Basically, just imagine that you are Han Solo in the Empire Strikes Back when he & the crew entered the asteroid field. Enjoy! 

## Gameplay
You are in a distant, remote planet and the first things you see are asteroids.Thankfully your spaceship has bullets and can fire many at a time.Use your bullets to shoot(Space key on your keyboard) asteroids.You begin with one token(spike) and when you destroy all of the asteroids, a token(spike) will appear in the game and you have to get that token(spike) to level up.If you don't get that token, your score will decrease and you will have to replay that level. But if you get that token, then that means you leveled up! Be careful, more asteroids are on the way. Try to evade them by using your arrow keys(up and down to be specific) on your keyboard and shoot them. When you have 3 tokens and you destroy all of the asteroids while you are still alive, then that means you successfully finished the game! A congrats message with your score will show up when you finish the game successfully.

## How to play
Download the source code and type:
```C:\.\Pygame-SpaceInvaders python3 SpaceInvaders.py```

Remember, you have to :
